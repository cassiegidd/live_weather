## Description

This webpage displays live weather and a five-day forecast for the users current location and a location that the users chooses and searches for. The webpage uses local storage to create buttons with the users most recent search history.

## Usage
Upon load, the user will be asked to approve geocaching of their current location. If approved, the webpage will laod with the users current location. The webpage will load the current weather of users location in the header of the application. Below the header a five day forecast of the users current location will be displayed. On the left of the five-day forecast is a search bar where the user can enter any US city name. When searched, the weather data on the webpage will adjust to the current and five day forecast of the city the user searched. Once the user has submitted a city in the search bar, a button will appear so that the user can click on any button of their recent searches to retrieve weather data for that city.
